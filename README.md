# Community Pergolas

# WHY?
We decided to work on this project because we saw a unique book API that we like.
API Link example: # https://api2.isbndb.com/book/#{isbn_string}
Our API link needs a API Key will only "PAYING" customers will get. We did a trail for 7 days (Thanks, Alex!)

# Why Communities
I would like to think that as a community that we are aiming/striving for a better future together. The first books that I ever owned were Nancy Drew books from a family friend's daugther. They were the only books I had before I made it to the library. I would like to think that a lot of children would benefit from reading actual books. 

There are already many book donation centers all over the world. Places where people can freely donate books and members of the community can come read. We would like to believe that our community members will work to better the community. We do not have the expectation that people will not steal books, but we hope that enough members of the community will enforce positive behavior. Our hope is that volunteers would step up, maintain the Pergolas, and the database. 

# How it works?
1. For all visitors that vist our site, we want them to be able to access the following pages:
Home // About // Contact // Pergolas#index - They can see where our Pergolas are and will be motivate to join our awesome community 

2. To access more of the site and more functions, we want our users to access what vistors can access and the following pages:
a. Book_Record#index - Books that are in our database. They can search to see if we have a book they want. 
b. Book_Record#show - This page will show the book information, which Pergola contains how many copies, and total copies
c. User#show -  User access their own pages only. They can change their information. They can also delete their accouts. 

3. Finally, we have our volunteers. Volunteers will be able to add books in our system. 
a. Our users(volunteers) will be update their profile to become an admin (unpaid) for our books database. 
They will be given a secret webpage and a code to update their profile
